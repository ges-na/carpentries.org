**Vision:** Our vision is to be the leading inclusive community teaching data and coding skills.

**Mission:** The Carpentries builds global capacity in essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research. We train and foster an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners and instructors that promotes and models the importance of software and data in research. We collaboratively develop openly-available lessons and deliver these lessons using evidence-based teaching practices. We focus on people conducting and supporting research.

Here you will find a range of useful information about our work. For more information on all things Carpentries, see [The Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/).  On our [Reports page](/reports/) you'll find our Annual Reports, Financial Reports, Grant Reports, and Assessment Reports.

#### About The Carpentries

The Carpentries project comprises the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>, <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a>, and <a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/">Library Carpentry</a> communities of Instructors, Trainers, Maintainers, helpers, and supporters who share a mission to teach foundational computational and data science skills to researchers. 

The Carpentries subscribes to a shared <a href="http://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>. In January, 2018, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry merged their projects to form <strong>The Carpentries</strong>. On November 1, 2018, The Carpentries Executive Council approved Library Carpentry as the third official Lesson Program of The Carpentries. The following two blog posts provide further background:  <i><a href="https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/09/merger.html">Joint future for Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry</a></i> and <i><a href="https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/11/welcoming-library-carpentry/">Library Carpentry is now officially a Lesson Program!</a></i>. Visit the individual <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>, <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a>, and <a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/">Library Carpentry</a> web sites for more detailed project histories.

[The Carpentries Strategic Plan](https://carpentries.org/strategic-plan) was developed by the Executive Council together with the Core Team and approved by the Executive Council in January 2020.

#### How is The Carpentries Managed?

The Carpentries is a fiscally sponsored project of <a href="http://communityin.org/">Community Initiatives</a>, 
a registered 501(c)3 non-profit based in California, USA. Dr. Kari L. Jordan is the Executive Director, and governance of the merged Carpentries is undertaken 
by an <a href="{{site.url}}/governance">Executive Council</a> which comprises 
four community-elected members and five appointed members drawn from 
The Carpentries community.

#### How is The Carpentries Funded?

We now have more than 80 [member organisations]({{site.url}}/members/) in 10 countries.  The memberships program generates 32.7% of revenue. Collectively, Workshops & Instructor Training generate 9.1% of revenue, while Grants & Donations generate 58.2% of revenue. These income streams support the work of the Core Team, workshop & lesson infrastructure, CarpentryCon, and our continued work towards The Carpentries mission.

You can <a href="https://carpentries.wedid.it/">donate to The Carpentries</a> using our online portal.

#### What Information is Where?

What is common across The Carpentries - the Code of Conduct, assessment, governance, instructor training, our privacy policy - will be found through this site, while specific Lesson Program material, will remain on the individual [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/), [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/), and <a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/">Library Carpentry</a> sites. We will increasingly post on The Carpentries [blog]({{site.url}}/blog/), rather than to individual Carpentries blog sites, and we will tweet
through our [Carpentries Twitter](https://twitter.com/thecarpentries) account.

#### Referencing The Carpentries

The Carpentries, while sounding plural, is a singular entity. Therefore, when referring to The Carpentries, verbs should also be singular, e.g. *'The Carpentries is ...'*. The correct title for the merged organisation is **The Carpentries**. However, you can use terminology such as *'A Carpentries workshop ...'*. We have a [Style Guide](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/resources/style-guide.html) to help you.
